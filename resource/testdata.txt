Stepanov",     "Paul McJones"    ],    "publisher": "Addison-Wesley Professional",    "publishedDate": "2009",    "description": "New techniques for building more secure, reliable, high-performance software, from the renowned creator of the C++ STL â€¢ â€¢ A truly foundational book on the discipline of generic programming: how to write better software by mastering the development of abstract components. â€¢ Based on Alexander Stepanov's breakthrough lectures to programmers at Adobe and throughout Silicon Valley. â€¢ For serious software developers, architects, and engineers, the perfect complement to Knuth's theory and Stoustrup's practice. Elements of Programming is the next breakthrough book for serious practitioners seeking ways to write better software. In this book, Alexander Stepanov - the legendary architect and creator of the C++ Standard Template Libraries - focuses on the discipline that offers the greatest potential for improving contemporary software: the proper development of abstract components. Drawing on his enormously popular lectures to programmers at Adobe and throughout Silicon Valley, Stepanov illuminates crucial techniques of generic programming, specifically focusing on abstraction as the key to secure, reliable, and high-performance software. Together with co-author and ACM Fellow Paul McJones, Stepanov shows programmers how to use mathematics to compose reliable algorithms from components, and to design effective interfaces between algorithms and data structures. Topics covered in Elements of Programming include: transformations, associative operations, linear orderings, ordered algebraic structures, iterators, coordinates and coordinate structures, copying algorithms, rearrangement, sorting, and much more. This book requires an understanding of mathematics, but is consistently focused on identifying superior solutions to practical programming problems. Stepanov and McJones illuminate their concepts and techniques with C++ code, but the techniques are equally applicable to a wide range of contemporary object-oriented languages.",    "industryIdentifiers": [     {

Designed to be used by readers with varying levels of programming expertise, it not only provides the foundations for music and audio development but also tackles issues that sometimes remain mysterious even to experienced software designers. Exercises and copious examples (all cross-platform and based on free or open source software) make the book ideal for classroom use. Fifteen chapters and eight appendixes cover such topics as programming basics for C and C++ (with music-oriented examples), audio programming basics and more advanced topics, spectral audio programming; programming Csound opcodes, and algorithmic synthesis and music programming. Appendixes cover topics in compiling, audio and MIDI, computing, and math. An accompanying DVD provides an additional 40 chapters, covering musical and audio programs with micro-controllers, alternate MIDI controllers, video controllers, developing Apple Audio Unit plug-ins from Csound opcodes, and audio programming for the iPhone.The sections and chapters of the book are arranged progressively and topics can be followed from chapter to chapter and from section to section. At the same time, each section can stand alone as a self-contained unit. Readers will find The Audio Programming Book a trustworthy companion on their journey through making music and programming audio on modern computers.",    "industryIdentifiers": [     {

The version of C used is the one standardised by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI C). C has rapidly gained users due to its efficiency, rich data structure, variety of operators and affinity to UNIX operating system. C is a difficult language to learn if it is not methodically approached. Our attempt has been to introduce the basic aspects of C to enable the student to quickly start writing C programs and postpone more difficult features of C to later chapters. The methodology of presentation closely follows the one used by the author in his popular book on PASCAL programming.

Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, has reorganized, extended, and completely rewritten his definitive reference and tutorial for programmers who want to use C++ most effectively. The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, delivers meticulous, richly explained, and integrated coverage of the entire languageâ€”its facilities, abstraction mechanisms, standard libraries, and key design techniques. Throughout, Stroustrup presents concise, â€œpure C++11â€? examples, which have been carefully crafted to clarify both usage and program design. To promote deeper understanding, the author provides extensive cross-references, both within the book and to the ISO standard. New C++11 coverage includes Support for concurrency Regular expressions, resource management pointers, random numbers, and improved containers General and uniform initialization, simplified for-statements, move semantics, and Unicode support Lambdas, general constant expressions, control over class defaults, variadic templates, template aliases, and user-defined literals Compatibility issues Topics addressed in this comprehensive book include Basic facilities: type, object, scope, storage, computation fundamentals, and more Modularity, as supported by namespaces, source files, and exception handling C++ abstraction, including classes, class hierarchies, and templates in support of a synthesis of traditional programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming Standard Library: containers, algorithms, iterators, utilities, strings, stream I/O, locales, numerics, and more The C++ basic memory model, in depth This fourth edition makes C++11 thoroughly accessible to programmers moving from C++98 or other languages, while introducing insights and techniques that even cutting-edge C++11 programmers will find indispensable. This book features an enhanced, layflat binding, which allows the book to stay open more easily when placed on a flat surface.

Ltd.",    "publishedDate": "1997-01-01",    "description": "This book introduces Computer Programming to a beginner, using Fortran 90 and its recent extension Fortran 95. While Fortran 77 has been used for many years and is currently very popular, computer scientists have been seriously concerned about good programming practice to promote development of reliable programs. Thus, the International Standards Organization set up a group to 'modernise' Fortran and introduce new features which have made languages such as Pascal and C popular. The committee took over a decade to come up with the new standard, Fortran 90. Fortran 90 has introduced many new features in Fortran, such as recursion, pointers, user-defined data types etc., which were hitherto available only in languages such as Pascal and C. Fortran 90 is not an evolutionary change of Fortran 77 but is drastically different. Though Fortran 77 programs can be run using a Fortran 90 compiler, Fortran 90 is so different that the author felt it was not a good idea to just revise Fortran 77 and introduce Fortran 90 in some places in the book. Thus this book is entirely new and introduces Fortran 90 from basics. In 1996 some small extensions were made to Fortran 90 and has called Fortran 95. This book also discusses these features. As all new programs in Fortran will henceforth be written in Fortran 90, it is essential for students to learn this language.The methodology of presentation, however, closely follows the one used by the author in his popular book on Fortran 77.",    "industryIdentifiers": [     {

I find that merely opening one has a very useful terrorizing effect on computers. â€”Jonathan Laventhol The first revision of this third volume is the most comprehensive survey of classical computer techniques for sorting and searching. It extends the treatment of data structures in Volume 1 to consider both large and small databases and internal and external memories.

    "title": "The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages",    "subtitle": "An Introduction",    "authors": [     "Glynn Winskel"    ],    "publisher": "MIT Press",    "publishedDate": "1993",    "description": "The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages provides the basic mathematical techniques necessary for those who are beginning a study of the semantics and logics of programming languages. These techniques will allow students to invent, formalize, and justify rules with which to reason about a variety of programming languages. Although the treatment is elementary, several of the topics covered are drawn from recent research, including the vital area of concurency. The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs.Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains. The book concludes with a chapter on parallel programming languages, accompanied by a discussion of methods for specifying and verifying nondeterministic and parallel programs.",    "industryIdentifiers": [     {

Such an effort would help researchers and users in the area to get a clear picture of the issues of specification, verification and design of real-time reactive programs. It will clearly enable us to identify languages that can be used for different kinds of applications. Obviously, in an upcoming area like this, this presentation is far from complete. The quintessence of the monograph can be captured by the following question: . How can we design and develop Robust Reactive (real-time) Programs?. We address this question in this monograph through the various underlying issues listed, such as characteristics of real-time/reactive programs, reactive programming languages, verification and refinements. Sample Chapter(s). Chapter 1: Real Time System Characteristics (78 KB).

Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that irritate oysters, programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers. With origins beyond solid engineering, in the realm of insight and creativity, Bentleyâ€™s pearls offer unique and clever solutions to those nagging problems. Illustrated by programs designed as much for fun as for instruction, the book is filled with lucid and witty descriptions of practical programming techniques and fundamental design principles. It is not at all surprising that Programming Pearls has been so highly valued by programmers at every level of experience. In this revision, the first in 14 years, Bentley has substantially updated his essays to reflect current programming methods and environments. In addition, there are three new essays on testing, debugging, and timing set representations string problems All the original programs have been rewritten, and an equal amount of new code has been generated. Implementations of all the programs, in C or C++, are now available on the Web. What remains the same in this new edition is Bentleyâ€™s focus on the hard core of programming problems and his delivery of workable solutions to those problems. Whether you are new to Bentleyâ€™s classic or are revisiting his work for some fresh insight, the book is sure to make your own list of favorites.",    "industryIdentifiers": [     {
